    <h3>directions</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and place in a bowl. Add yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, garam masala, paprika, cumin, turmeric, and salt. Mix well and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Thread the marinated chicken onto skewers and brush with vegetable oil. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until browned and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, heavy cream, sugar, and salt. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Add the grilled chicken to the sauce and let it simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until the chicken is fully coated in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rinse the rice until the water runs clear. Add the rice and water to a pot with a pinch of salt, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cumin seeds. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover. Cook for 18-20 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.</li>
        <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and serve alongside the chicken tikka masala. Garnish with fresh cilantro if desired. Enjoy!</li>
